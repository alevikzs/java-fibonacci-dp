# Java implementation of Fibonacci algorithm.

The Fibonacci algorithm is a mathematical formula that generates a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. This sequence has numerous applications in computer science, such as generating random numbers, coding theory, and cryptography.

The algorithm can be implemented using both recursion and dynamic programming. The recursive approach involves defining the function in terms of itself, where the function calls itself with smaller inputs until it reaches the base case (usually 0 or 1) and then returns the value. This approach is simple and easy to understand but can be inefficient for larger inputs due to repeated calculations.

Dynamic programming, on the other hand, involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. In the case of the Fibonacci sequence, this means storing previously calculated values in a table or array and using them to calculate future values. This approach can be more efficient than recursion, especially for larger inputs, but requires more memory to store the table of values.
